# üìö Deep Technical Documentation on Model Context Protocol (MCP)

---

# 1. What is MCP?  

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that **defines how AI models (clients)** can **connect to, request, and interact with external resources, tools, and prompts** ‚Äî securely, consistently, and efficiently.

It is designed to **solve** the M√óN integration problem between:
- M AI models
- N external tools, databases, services

Instead of custom integrations for each AI <-> service combination, **MCP creates a universal bridge**:  
**Clients ‚Üî Servers**.

---

# 2. Core Concept

**You (the developer)** build a **MCP Server**, which **exposes**:

| Primitive  | Purpose                                                | Analogy            |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Resources  | Static or dynamic content (text, files, database rows)  | Like RESTful GET   |
| Tools      | Executable functions with arguments                    | Like POST/PUT APIs |
| Prompts    | Predefined templates that guide the AI                 | LLM Prompt Kits    |

**Clients** (like Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, custom AI Agents) **connect** to your server, **discover** these primitives, and **interact** dynamically.

**‚Üí Servers are "AI-Ready Microservices."**

---

# 3. Architectural Roles

| Role    | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Host** | The application that runs AI models (Claude Desktop, etc.) |
| **Client** | A 1:1 logical connection between Host and Server |
| **Server** | An external system exposing MCP Resources, Tools, and Prompts |

You **build the Server** side!

---

# 4. Protocol Layers

| Layer         | Responsibility                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Transport** | Moves JSON-RPC messages (e.g., over stdio, HTTP) |
| **Protocol**  | Defines structured messages, requests, responses |
| **Application** | Defines Resources, Tools, Prompts and their behavior |

---

# 5. Transports (Communication Mediums)

**MCP supports two official transports:**

| Transport | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| **Stdio** | Local process communication (same machine). Standard input/output streams. |
| **HTTP + SSE** | Network communication. HTTP POST + Server-Sent Events for bidirectional messaging. |

‚úÖ Stdio = easier to start (for local dev, Claude Desktop integration).

---

# 6. Message Format (over any Transport)

MCP uses **JSON-RPC 2.0** for all its messages.

| Type         | Purpose  | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Request      | Client asks Server to perform action | `resources/list`, `tools/call`, etc. |
| Response     | Server answers the Request | Result or Error |
| Notification | Server sends info without expecting a reply | Resource Updated |

Each message looks like:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "1234",
  "method": "resources/list",
  "params": { ... }
}
```

Or a notification:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/resources/list_changed",
  "params": { ... }
}
```

---

# 7. MCP Core Primitives (as a Server Developer)

## üìÑ Resources

**Resources** are **content** you expose.

Example:
- Text files
- Database records
- API responses
- Images, PDFs

Each Resource has:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `uri` | Unique identifier (`file:///`, `postgresql:///`, `screen:///`) |
| `name` | Human readable |
| `description` | Optional explanation |
| `mimeType` | MIME type (e.g., `text/plain`, `application/pdf`) |

Clients **read** resources via `resources/read`.

---
## üîß Tools

**Tools** are **actions or functions** AI can call.

Example:
- Search files
- Create a new file
- Query a database
- Execute a command

Each Tool has:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `name` | Unique function name |
| `description` | Human-friendly summary |
| `inputSchema` | JSON Schema for expected arguments |
| `annotations` | Optional metadata (readOnly, destructive, idempotent hints) |

Tools are **called** via `tools/call`.

---

## üìù Prompts

**Prompts** are **pre-written templates** that AI can use.

Example:
- "Summarize the following document"
- "Write a project plan based on this file"

Prompts are listed via `prompts/list` and sent with variables when needed.

---

# 8. Key MCP Server Endpoints You Must Handle

As an MCP Server, you handle requests like:

| Method              | Purpose                                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `initialize`         | Client connects. Server replies with capabilities. |
| `resources/list`    | List available Resources |
| `resources/read`    | Provide the content of Resources |
| `tools/list`        | List available Tools |
| `tools/call`        | Execute a Tool |
| `prompts/list`      | List available Prompts |
| `sampling/createMessage` | (optional) Ask client to sample a completion |

---

# 9. Server Initialization Flow

Typical startup of an MCP server:

1. **Start transport** (stdio, HTTP, etc.)
2. **Wait for initialize request** from client
3. **Negotiate capabilities** (what you support)
4. **Wait for resource/tool/prompt requests** and serve them
5. **Handle logging, error reporting, and optional sampling**

---

# 10. Server Capabilities Declaration

When you respond to `initialize`, you declare capabilities like:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "resources": {},    // You provide Resources
    "tools": {},        // You provide Tools
    "prompts": {},      // (Optional) You provide Prompts
    "sampling": {},     // (Optional) You can initiate Sampling
  }
}
```

‚úÖ No capabilities? Your server won‚Äôt be usable.

---

# 11. Error Handling

If something goes wrong:

- Return a **structured error** (code, message, optional data).
- Use standard JSON-RPC error codes for common errors.

Example:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "abcd",
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Invalid parameters",
    "data": "Resource not found: file:///bad/path"
  }
}
```

---

# 12. Security Design Principles (Critical!)

üîí MCP assumes you, as Server Developer, will **enforce security**, such as:

- Always validate input parameters (URIs, file paths, arguments).
- Prevent directory traversal attacks (`../../etc/passwd`).
- Carefully design which Tools can modify or delete data.
- Limit or sandbox destructive operations.
- Respect user consent for sensitive resource access.
- Avoid leaking sensitive environment variables.

If you expose Tools like "Delete File", **gating and confirmation are recommended.**

---

# 13. Server Notifications

You can **push notifications** to Clients:

| Notification | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| `notifications/resources/list_changed` | Resource list has changed (e.g., file created) |
| `notifications/resources/updated` | Specific resource updated |
| `notifications/tools/list_changed` | New tools added, old removed |

Useful for **dynamic** workspaces.

---

# 14. Sampling (Advanced)

MCP allows Servers to ask **Clients to perform LLM sampling**:

- Server sends `sampling/createMessage`
- Client performs text generation with user approval
- Server receives completion

Allows **agentic behaviors** ‚Äî agents reasoning with your Workspace!

(This is optional and not yet available in all clients.)

---

# 15. Example MCP Client Applications

| Client Name | What it does |
|-------------|--------------|
| Claude Desktop | Exposes local AI assistant with MCP server connections |
| Cursor IDE | Coding assistant powered by AI and MCP |
| LangGraph | AI workflow orchestrator |
| Semantic Kernel | .NET SDK for building AI agents using MCP |

If you build your server correctly, it can **connect to all of these** automatically!

---

# 16. Practical Example: Filesystem MCP Server

Your server (like Smart Workspace Manager):

- Lists files under `/Users/you/Documents/Workspace`
- Reads `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf` files as Resources
- Provides Tools:
  - Search files
  - Summarize text
  - Create a new Markdown note
- (Optionally) Subscribe to file changes
- Fully MCP compliant

This is exactly the kind of server you're planning to build!

---

# üìã Quick Summary Table

| Area                  | Key Takeaway |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Transport              | Stdio for local, HTTP+SSE for network |
| Message Format         | JSON-RPC 2.0 |
| Core Primitives        | Resources, Tools, Prompts |
| Required Endpoints     | initialize, resources/list, tools/list, etc. |
| Security Focus         | Validate input, gate destructive actions |
| Sampling (optional)    | Server requests LLM completions via client |

---

# üèóÔ∏è Where This Leads

- MCP becomes **your API** to **any future AI client**.
- Your server becomes **a modular AI agent plugin**.
- You build once, and connect to **Claude**, **OpenAI models**, **future LLMs** ‚Äî all automatically.


Excellent ‚Äî you're right to ask for **even more**.

Let‚Äôs **deepen** the technical dive into **MCP internals** now, beyond what basic tutorials or guides typically explain.  
I‚Äôll focus this next part on **lower-level mechanics**, **design philosophy**, **edge cases**, **patterns**, and **real-world developer considerations**.

---

# üî• Advanced Technical Internals of Model Context Protocol (MCP)

---

# 1. MCP Design Philosophy (Why MCP looks the way it does)

- **Minimal but powerful:** MCP deliberately limits itself to a few **primitives** (Resources, Tools, Prompts, Sampling) to remain universal across domains (coding, healthcare, robotics, etc.).
- **Asymmetric control:** Clients always control **when** and **how** they interact with servers. Servers do not initiate random actions ‚Äî they react.
- **Human-in-the-loop critical:** Unlike autonomous protocols (like raw API calls), MCP is built assuming **humans** must approve or intervene at key points (e.g., tool invocation, sampling).
- **Stateful negotiation:** Each Client-Server session negotiates capabilities and retains context until closed.
- **Extensibility first:** Future MCP versions can add new primitives, transports, or annotations without breaking backwards compatibility.
- **Security and Consent First:** Consent gates and permission systems are core assumptions in MCP‚Äôs usage. Accessing sensitive data or dangerous tools must involve **explicit trust management**.

---

# 2. Deeper into Message Lifecycle (Request-Response-Notification Model)

MCP maps **strictly** to **JSON-RPC** semantics:

| Concept        | MCP Request         | Response         | Notification         |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Data retrieval | `resources/list`, `read` | Resource data    | Resource change update |
| Action request | `tools/call`            | Action result    | None |
| Context expansion | `sampling/createMessage` | Sampled response | None |

**State Machine Concept:**
- Client sends request ‚Üí Server receives request ‚Üí Server replies or errors.
- Server can **also emit** notifications asynchronously.

---
  
# 3. Resource Internals (Deep Dive)

- **URI Design:**
  - URIs must **fully identify** a unique resource.
  - MCP does **not** require URIs to point to real-world internet objects.
  - URIs can be:
    - `file:///local/path`
    - `postgresql:///db/table`
    - `screen://display/1`
    - `memory://cache/object`
  - You can define **your own custom URI schemes** if needed.

- **Resource Variants:**
  - Static (file content)
  - Dynamic (query result)
  - Multi-content (e.g., reading a folder returns all files inside)

- **Resource Content:**
  - Text (UTF-8 string)
  - Binary (base64 encoded blob)

- **Resource Updates:**
  - Servers may push `resources/updated` notifications when resources change.
  - Clients can **subscribe** and **unsubscribe** for updates.

---
  
# 4. Tools Internals (Deep Dive)

**Tool Execution Rules:**
- Tools must validate all incoming arguments against the declared `inputSchema`.
- Tool results must be structured consistently:
  - `content`: Array of results
  - `isError`: Flag if an operation failed logically (e.g., "user not found")
  
**Tool Content Types in Result:**
- `text`
- `image`
- `embedded_resource` (attach a Resource output)

**Tool Annotations: (Hints, not Enforcement!)**
- `readOnlyHint`: Does not modify system state.
- `destructiveHint`: Might delete, modify, or otherwise impact system state.
- `idempotentHint`: Safe to retry with the same arguments.
- `openWorldHint`: Contacts external systems outside your local environment.

> **Important:**  
> **Clients** might choose to **block, warn, or prioritize** Tools depending on these annotations ‚Äî but **servers must still enforce real security.**

---

# 5. Prompts Internals

Prompts allow:
- Preloading the AI model with task instructions.
- Providing *parameterized* prompts (`variables` field).
- Acting like "function definitions" for AI-generated behavior.

Clients might:
- **Render prompts visually** for human selection.
- **Auto-inject prompts** into the AI conversation flow.
  
Servers should:
- Provide clear **descriptions** and **sample usage**.
- Minimize ambiguity in variable names (e.g., use `filename`, not `f`).

---

# 6. Sampling Internals

Sampling is where **your server** can request **AI completions** through the **client's model**.

Server specifies:
- Past conversation history (messages).
- System prompt override (optional).
- Context inclusion (from its Resources).
- Model preferences (cheap, fast, smart priorities).
- Max tokens, stop sequences, temperature.

**Then:**
- Client MAY modify the request (for safety).
- Client samples a response.
- Client MAY edit or reject the result before returning.

> **Critical:** Sampling is not guaranteed! Clients are always in control.

---

# 7. Initialization and Capability Negotiation

When a session starts:

**Client ‚Üí Server:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "capabilities": { "roots": {} }
  }
}
```

**Server ‚Üí Client:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "capabilities": {
      "resources": {},
      "tools": {},
      "prompts": {}
    }
  }
}
```

- Versions must match or be backwards compatible.
- Capability sets are compared.  
- If mismatched, connection may close or fall back.

---

# 8. Roots

Roots are:
- **Directories** (local filesystems)
- **APIs** (api://)
- **Systems** (screen://, workspace://)

Clients suggest Roots at connection time.

Servers **should**:
- Only expose Resources/Tools within declared Roots (unless otherwise configured).

---

# 9. Notifications and Subscriptions

| Event Type | Use |
|------------|-----|
| `resources/list_changed` | New files appear, documents deleted |
| `resources/updated` | File changed, database record updated |
| `tools/list_changed` | Server adds or removes Tools |

Clients may ignore notifications if they want.

---

# 10. Edge Cases Developers Must Handle

‚úÖ Client disconnects mid-operation ‚Üí gracefully cancel.

‚úÖ Resource read too large (gigabytes) ‚Üí chunk or reject with error.

‚úÖ Tool arguments missing ‚Üí reject early, fail clearly.

‚úÖ Tool runtime crash ‚Üí return structured error, do not crash server.

‚úÖ Multiple roots ‚Üí segregate resources logically, handle conflicts.

‚úÖ Server initialization fails ‚Üí report `InternalError` (-32603) clearly.

---

# 11. Authentication and Security Best Practices

üîí Server-side, enforce:
- **Input validation:** Always sanitize URIs, arguments, prompt variables.
- **Authorization checks:** For critical tools or private resources.
- **Audit logging:** Track who accessed what, when.
- **Encrypted transport:** Especially if over HTTP/SSE.
- **Strict capability declaration:** Don't expose features you don't intend.
- **Rate limiting:** Prevent resource or tool abuse.

---

# 12. Scalability Considerations

When your Smart Workspace Manager grows:
- Use **async IO** (Python `asyncio`, NodeJS `await`) for resource reads and tool execution.
- Implement **timeouts** for tool execution.
- **Paginate** large resource lists.
- **Cache** frequently accessed Resources.
- **Throttle** notifications to prevent flooding.

---

# 13. Future Expansion of MCP (roadmap hints)

Anthropic and the MCP community plan to:
- Add support for richer media types (video, audio in resources).
- Expand Sampling to include better feedback channels.
- Add support for Server-Initiated requests (agent collaboration).
- Define standard Resource URIs for popular services (standardization).
- Build stronger multi-tenant server support (enterprise scaling).
- Introduce richer metadata on Resources and Tools.

---

# üõ†Ô∏è Quick MCP Server Developer Checklist

‚úÖ Implement `initialize`, `resources/list`, `resources/read`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`  
‚úÖ Validate URIs, inputs, and outputs  
‚úÖ Handle disconnections and errors robustly  
‚úÖ Enforce security and consent rigorously  
‚úÖ Provide good annotations and descriptions for UX  
‚úÖ Use transport logging for debugging  
‚úÖ Keep your server composable and modular

---

# üì¢ Summary

> MCP **is not just an API**.  
> It is **a universal AI integration contract** ‚Äî secure, modular, expandable, and human-centric.

Building an MCP server means building a **first-class extension of AI capabilities** into the real world.
