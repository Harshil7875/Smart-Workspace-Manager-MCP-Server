# Smart Workspace Manager

## 1. Project Overview

**Smart Workspace Manager** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to act as a **personal knowledge and productivity assistant** by exposing your local workspace — files, notes, documents, and projects — as structured resources and actionable tools to Large Language Models (LLMs).

This project aims to tightly integrate LLM capabilities with your filesystem and organizational workflows, allowing AI models to **search**, **summarize**, **analyze**, and **manipulate** your local content in a secure, structured way, with **human approval in the loop**.

---

## 2. Motivation

As LLMs become increasingly powerful, the major bottleneck is **context access**: models cannot easily view and work with your private files, documents, or notes.

Building one-off integrations is tedious and non-standard.  
Smart Workspace Manager uses **MCP** to create a **universal, extensible, and secure bridge** between your files and LLM applications like Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, or your custom apps.

The goal is to:
- Supercharge personal productivity using AI.
- Maintain full privacy and control over your data.
- Explore intelligent agentic workflows (e.g., automatic task summarization, document analysis, smart organization).

---

## 3. Vision

In the future, users should be able to say:
> "Claude, please find all notes about Project X, summarize them, and draft a new plan in a new file."

And the model would:
- Search local files (via Resources)
- Read content intelligently
- Summarize using Sampling
- Create a new document (via Tools)

All **without** hardcoding anything model-specific, and without manual browsing.

Smart Workspace Manager makes this possible.

## 4. System Design Overview

The system is built around **MCP Primitives**:

| MCP Primitive | Role in Smart Workspace Manager |
|:--------------|:---------------------------------|
| **Resources** | Expose files and documents as browsable resources |
| **Tools** | Provide actions like search, summarize, create, delete, organize |
| **Roots** | Define workspace folder(s) where the server operates |
| **Sampling** (Future phase) | Allow AI to draft new documents or notes |

## 5. Core Components

### 5.1 Server Setup

- An MCP-compliant server that listens for connections over **stdio** (local).
- Supports standard MCP features:
  - Resource discovery
  - Tool listing and invocation
  - Subscription to file updates (later)
  - Basic logging and error reporting

### 5.2 Resource Manager

Responsible for:
- Scanning a target directory (e.g., `~/Documents/Workspace`)
- Representing files (text files, PDFs, Markdown, etc.) as MCP Resources
- Generating metadata (file size, last modified date, type)
- Allowing **read** access through `resources/read`
- Future: Real-time subscription to file changes (`resources/subscribe`)

### 5.3 Tool Manager

Exposes useful Tools to the LLM:

| Tool Name | Purpose | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `search_files` | Search files by name/content | Given a query, return matching file URIs |
| `summarize_file` | Summarize a file's content | Read a file and generate a short summary |
| `create_note` | Create a new note | Create a new Markdown or TXT file |
| `delete_file` | Delete a file | Securely delete a file |
| `move_file` | Move/rename a file | Organize workspace files |

All Tools will:
- Accept JSON-validated input schemas
- Return structured, easy-to-parse results
- Include descriptive metadata for model understanding

> **Security Note:**  
> Destructive tools (delete, move) will be gated behind additional server settings (disabled by default).

### 5.4 Configuration

The server will allow lightweight configuration via:
- Environment variables (`.env` file)
- Command-line arguments (later stage)

Settings include:
- Target workspace directory
- Allowed file types (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`)
- Max file size limit
- Tool access restrictions (e.g., allow or disable delete)

---

## 6. Key Design Decisions

- **Python SDK**: To leverage fast prototyping, clean file handling, and easy MCP SDK integration.
- **MCP stdio Transport**: Initial communication will be through standard input/output for local testing with Inspector and Claude Desktop.
- **Extensibility First**: Easy to add new Tools (like AI-enhanced tagging, document clustering) later.
- **Security Focus**: 
  - Read-only mode by default.
  - Explicit opt-in for file modification/deletion.
  - Only target specific folders.
- **Performance**: 
  - File metadata caching (in-memory) if needed for large workspaces.
  - Async operations where appropriate.

## 7. Development Phases

| Phase | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| Phase 1 | Basic MCP server with resource listing |
| Phase 2 | Add simple file search and summary tools |
| Phase 3 | Add file creation and organization tools |
| Phase 4 | Implement update notifications (subscription) |
| Phase 5 | Add Sampling support for "drafting" documents |
| Phase 6 | Polish configuration and security settings |
| Phase 7 | Publish as open-source / personal CLI app |

## 8. Example User Stories

- **Story 1:**  
> "Find all notes mentioning 'conference presentation' and summarize them into one page."

- **Story 2:**  
> "Create a new file called 'ideas.md' in the workspace and open it for editing."

- **Story 3:**  
> "List all recently updated documents in the Projects folder."

- **Story 4:**  
> "Delete the file `notes_old.txt` from the workspace."

- **Story 5:**  
> "Summarize `meeting_notes_2025-04-29.md` into bullet points."

---

## 9. Future Expansion Ideas

- **Semantic search**: Vectorize documents for smarter file search.
- **Task extraction**: Parse tasks/TODOs from notes automatically.
- **Auto-organization**: Suggest folder structures for messy files.
- **Multimodal resources**: Add image, audio file support.
- **Remote access**: Optionally expose workspace to remote clients securely.

# **Summary**

**Smart Workspace Manager** is a modular, secure, AI-powered personal workspace manager built on the open Model Context Protocol standard.

It aims to bring AI closer to your daily workflows — securely, locally, and flexibly — without needing to reinvent the wheel every time you want your LLM to *"see"* your files.
